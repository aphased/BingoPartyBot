# Command List

> :exclamation: **Please Note**: This list merely provides a rough overview over all available commands. For additional information including **description**, **usage details** and **aliases** for every command, as well as some general tips, it is highly recommended you visit the [__**Documentation repository on GitHub ↗**__](https://github.com/aphased/BingoPartyCommands/). Alternatively, information about individual commands can also be obtained through the `help` command by running `!p help <command>` in-game (e.g. `!p help test`).

Execute any of these commands by running **`/msg BingoParty !p <command>`** in-game (e.g. `/msg BingoParty !p test`), provided, of course, you meet the permission requirement.

## Public Commands
Available to everyone. Note some of these commands are executed by directly sending them into the party chat.
