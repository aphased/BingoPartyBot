 * and an optional `ignore` property. If the `ignore` property is false or
 * undefined, the command will be added to the returned collection. In the
 * future, this might expand to requiring a command description, too.
 *
 * The function handles errors that may occur while reading the directory
 * and importing the command files, logging them to the console and
